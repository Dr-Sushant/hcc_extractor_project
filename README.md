# 🩺 Clinical ICD-10 Extractor

A lightweight clinical NLP application that extracts **ICD-10 diagnosis codes** from free-text clinical notes and maps them to corresponding **HCC (Hierarchical Condition Category) risk categories**.

# 💡 Project Objective

Healthcare documentation is largely unstructured.

This project demonstrates how clinical notes can be automatically analyzed to identify diagnosis concepts and map them to ICD-10 codes and HCC risk categories using a lightweight rule-based NLP pipeline.

The application accepts either:

* Free-text clinical notes
* Direct ICD-10 code input

and returns structured coding information.

## Example 2 – Chronic Kidney Disease

Patient diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3.

**Expected Detection**

ICD-10: N18.3

HCC: 138

---

## Example 3 – HIV

HIV-positive patient with declining CD4 count.

**Expected Detection**

ICD-10: B20

HCC: 1

---

## Example 4 – Leukemia

Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed following bone marrow biopsy.

**Expected Detection**
